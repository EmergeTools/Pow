# Overview

Pow features a selection of [SwiftUI transitions](#transitions) as well as [Change Effects](#change-effects) that trigger every time a value is updated.

You can find previews of all effects [on the Pow website](https://movingparts.io/pow). If you have an iOS Developer Environment, you can check out the [Pow Example App](https://github.com/movingparts-io/Pow-Examples).

## Change Effects

Change Effects are effects that will trigger a visual or haptic every time a value changes.

Use the `changeEffect` modifier and pass in an `AnyChangeEffect` as well as a value to watch for changes.

```swift
Button {
    post.toggleLike()
} label: {
    Label(post.likes.formatted(), systemName: "heart.fill")
}
.changeEffect(.spray { heart }, value: post.likes, isEnabled: post.isLiked)
.tint(post.isLiked ? .red : .gray)
```

You can choose from the following Change Effects: [Spray](#spray), [Haptic Feedback](#haptic-feedback), [Jump](#jump), [Ping](#ping), [Rise](#rise), [Shake](#shake), [Shine](#shine), and [Spin](#spin).

The shine moves from the top leading edge to bottom trailing edge.

```swift
static func shine(duration: Double) -> AnyChangeEffect

  - axis: The x, y and z elements that specify the axis of rotation.
  - anchor: The location with a default of center that defines a point in 3D space about which the rotation is anchored.

## Particle Layer

A particle layer is a context in which particle effects draw their particles.

The `particleLayer(name:)` view modifier wraps the view in a particle layer with the given name.

Particle effects such as `AnyChangeEffect.spray` can render their particles on this position in the view tree to avoid being clipped by their immediate ancestor.

For example, certain `List` styles may clip their rows. Use `particleLayer(_:)` to render particles on top of the entire `List` or even its enclosing `NavigationStack`.

```swift
func particleLayer(name: AnyHashable) -> some View
```

## Transitions

All transitions are namespaced under the `movingParts` static variable, e.g.

```swift
myView.transition(.movingParts.anvil)
```
